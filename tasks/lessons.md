## 2026-03-04
- What went wrong: The prior rewrite drifted away from the original one-click advice identity and felt too generic.
- Root cause: Product intent was translated into broad coaching patterns without preserving the core instant-advice loop as the dominant interaction.
- Prevention rule: For each product rewrite, lock the primary loop in tests and README first, then reject any UI changes that demote that loop from first-screen focus.
